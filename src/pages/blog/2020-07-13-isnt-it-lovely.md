**To be alone, or to be lonely.**

It's seven past twenty and I'm still here tapping on my keyboard doing my office work even though it has been way past my office hour. Not only today, it has been going on for months(since the start of the lockdown to be exact).

Yeah, I could close it all and ignore all calls and chill out. But, I do what I do and I keep on doing my tasks like it's my responsibility to complete these tasks.
